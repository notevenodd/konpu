**ilo Konpu** is a tiny retro-like canvas/environment.

## goals

- small and simple C program, also fast.
- has a [retro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_computer "retro")-like feel.
- provides a primarily [text-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface "text-oriented") environment (with some similarities to a [terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator "terminal emulator")) but also offers the possibility to do [limited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_clash "limited") graphics.
- native support for [toki pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona "toki pona") (the main 8-bit character set supports printable ASCII and basic sitelen pona).

## status

early work in progress.
